            <p tabindex="0">Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy, so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people, but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.</p>
            <p tabindex="0">Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers, she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets, Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human food such as lettuce.</p>

            <p tabindex="0">Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <p tabindex="0">At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

He will throw his ball down the stairs and play fetch with himself if you don’t give him attention. He will also throw his food and water bowl to let us know he wants more.</p>
            <p tabindex="0">River is obsessed with my mom. My mom is the one who mostly walks him and gives him treats. Anywhere my mom goes, River follows. If she's gone for 2 minutes, he will frantically search the house for her. Although he likes being with people, he hates being cuddled or held.</p>

            <p tabindex="0">Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun on his side and lounging. He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but eventually, he gets bored and just stops fetching them and lays down.</p>
            <p tabindex="0">Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn’t like water (showers and even rain) or getting his nails clipped, and he’s sometimes even so lazy that he’ll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back home. </p>

            <p tabindex="0">When Daisy isn’t busy slaying all of the evil snakes trying to attack us (Pictured Above), you can usually find her annoying her older sister Marina, getting super hyper at completely random times, or relaxing in our backyard making sure she keeps out all of the intruders (squirrels)</p>
            <p tabindex="0">One of Daisy’s favorite things to do is beg to go on a walk, and then once we’re about half way done with the walk she likes to lay down and refuse to keep going. She then loves being carried all the way back from said walk, and the process will repeat again later in the day.</p>
